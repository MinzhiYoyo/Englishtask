# History

In 1852, the company, with William Francis, joined Richard Taylor's publishing business, which had been established in 1798. William Francis's son, Richard Taunton Francis (1883-1930), was the sole partner in the company from 1917 to 1930.

In 1990, the company withdrew from the printing industry and focused solely on publishing. In 1998, it went public on the London Stock Exchange and acquired its academic publishing competitor, Routledge, for Â£90 million in the same year. In 2004, it merged with Informa to form T&F Informa, which later reverted to the name Informa. After the merger, T&F closed Routledge's London office and relocated to its current headquarters in Milton Park, Oxfordshire.

In 2017, T&F acquired the digital resource company Colwiz. In January 2020, T&F acquired the open research publishing platform F1000. [1]
